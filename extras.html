    <h1>Validation Images of HTML Pages as Extras?</h1>
  </header><br><br>

  <div class="main">

    <h2>Why would anyone show their validation pages on a website?</h2><br>
      
    <p>Let's think of this like a business. My product is a website. I'm new to market and my customers are fellow students reviewing the website. Also, my website is not yet the most advanced or the best product out there.  However, I do know certain minimum standards must be met in the marketplace to even possibly receive a sale (or in this case, a passing grade). Some of these features include menus, multiple viewport sizes, images and proof of validated webpages. But to really have a chance to make a sale (recieve a top grade), the website must contain extras to impress the customer enough to make that sale. I also want the customer to feel that I understand the value of their time so I provide images of validatd pages to make it easy for them to meet this grading rubric. It's of low cost to me (the producer),but high value to the customer (you).

    <h3>My list of Extras are shown below<h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Viewports: Three sizes at Mobile, 780px and 1024px with each size having a different layout, footer formatting and color scheme.</li>
            <li>Animated menu with JavaScript: Menu is static at 1024px, narrows and static at 780px and animates to a hamburger icon on Mobile with items that change color on hover</li>
            <li>Sticky footer: transparent footer that changes size and color scheme among the three viewports</li>
            <li>Lightbox: Images of HTML validation pages on the "Extras" page</li>
            <li>Forms: Checkboxes and radio buttons</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

                <h4>What are your "Extras"?</h4>
            
                
                <p><b>Question:</b> You might be thinking, why do I need to offer "extras", I already do a great job for my customers and clients?</p> 
                <p><b>Answer:</b> Sure, you do great work. Even if your clients appreciate your effort and say thank you, they are also thinking you did what you were paid to do and no more thoughts of you enter their minds. What if you made them so excited that they wanted to talk about you in casual conversation? In passing, "Linda" tells her friend at lunch that "Gary" is a life saver. He got my site right back up just as I started my Fall sale. She says, "He's always doing little things to help: I can call him anytime for advice when shopping for new computers. He really takes the stress out of the process for me." That's free advertising and an excited client. Even when you are a customer, it's the little things that count.</p>
                
                
                <p><b>Question:</b> If you are already in business or thinking of starting a business what extras can you offer your customers and clients?</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> You could offer free computer advice, how much does that cost? What about knowing Linda's sale schedule ahead of time to make sure the site is ready for extra traffic. If you prepare income taxes, how much does it cost to send a reminder email that it's time for the mid-year tax payment? If you're a web designer, maybe you find a better color scheme, send and offline example to the client and offer to make the changes below your normal rate. How much does that cost compared to the customers satisfaction? Good luck with building even more customer loyalty.</p>
