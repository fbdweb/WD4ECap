    <h2>What do you mean, am I already in business?</h2><br>

    <p>Most people would think that someone would know if they are already in business or not? Some do, but for someone who has been an employee their whole life it might not be that simple to figure out. If you're doing something similar to what you did as an employee, it doesn't seem all that different to you, but from a business standpoint it is. Also, sometimes it simply comes down to how much an individual understands about being in business. If you already have a business, you would be or could be deducting expenses against the money you make.</p>
    
    <p>It's important to note that you would not be getting a paycheck if you are in business for yourself. If you are receiving payments or checks, but these are not paychecks (e.g. taxes withheld), they are revenue sources to your company that can be offset by expenses.  As a side note, if you work through a temp agency that places you in a temporary or contract position at a company, you are still considered to be an employee since, in most cases, the agency regularly sends you a paycheck.

        </ol><br>

        <p>Now let's see if the taxing authorities think you are in business.</p>
        <ul id="irs">
          <li>
            <p>Have you worked for someone and then received a 1099-Misc from a company instead of a W-2 at tax time?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="1099" required value="1099">Yes</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="1099" required value="1099">No</label></li>
          <!--<input type='submit' value="Click Here">-->
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
    </form><br>

    <h3>Summary </h3>

    <p>If you received a 1099 for doing work somebody else, then you definitely earned taxable income and have to enter it on your tax return. When you receive a 1099, the IRS would expect to see the income on your tax return. As mentioned earlier, the good news is that if you incurred any costs, then you can deduct most of these costs as business expenses such as computer, mileage, office supplies and others against your income, subject to specific tax rules.</p>

    <p>Even if you aren't officially in business, you may be well on your way. Many people start by doing an ocassional side project that turns into a part-time business and then a full-fledged business with multiple customers and employees.</p>

    <h4>Questions you might have on payroll and taxes</h4>

    
    <p><b>Question:</b> If payments to me are for my company, how do I pay myself?</p> 
    <p><b>Answer:</b> In most cases you pay yourself by taking owner draws. Owner draws aren't generally taxed since the taxable part is determined by subtracting expenses from your revenue to determine taxable income. You can't, however, just take all the money out of the business without tracking it. You need money in the business to pay business expenses and the tax return has to show your revenu and expenses. There are a few exceptions to an owner receiving paychecks from the business, but that usually happens when the business is set up as a corporation.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>Question:</b> How do I pay my taxes if I don't have taxes taken out of a paycheck?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b> taxes are submitted quarterly to the IRS and to your state based on the income you estimate to make for the year.  It's more complicated than that, but those are the basic mechanics.</p>
