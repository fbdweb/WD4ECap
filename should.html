      <h2>What do you mean, should I start a business?</h2><br>
              
      <p>Some people never even think about or want to start a business. They see it as a hassle. Some people are gung-ho and start businesses when they are 12 years old (e.g. billionaire Mark Cuban owner of the NBA Dallas Mavericks). These types never really doubt that entrepreneurship is their life pursuit. Others can't wait to become "former" employees and realize that working for themselves would be more rewarding personally and possibly financially. </p>
                  
      <p>And then there's the rest of us. Yes, all of us who are uncertain. Where the doubts, uncertainties and questions have to be addressed and resolved before even seriously thinking about beginning the process of starting a business. The most important approach for you is honesty with yourself.</p><br> 
                  
      <p>For the other groups, it's not as hard. The "never" group never thinks about it.  The "gung-ho" group just plunges ahead and learns by trial and error. The "former employee" group either has resolved their doubts or just got to the point where independence mattered more. For the "uncertain" group all the answers aren't there yet. To help clarify the uncetainty, answer the questiongs to see if it seems to make more sense than not to start a business.

      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>When you read through the questions above, I hope you came to the realization that having your own business can be fun and rewarding, but that doesn't mean it will be easy.  If you only checked off one or two boxes, it could be that you should wait for a better time in your life.  If you checked off a few more boxes, then maybe it's time to seriously think about pursuing your dream.</p>  
                  
      <p>If you did not check questions #1, 7 or 8 and especially #7 and #8, then maybe you need to think about doing your passion as a side hobby or just for fun. You can be sure that there will always be ups and downs. For example, that contract you were guaranteed to get that doesn't come through. Or the big client that you thought would always send business your way--until they can't because of their own issues. Bouncing back from hard times is a key to having a successful business.</p>

      <p>If you decide that starting your own business is not right for you, that is not a failure. It just means that you should focus on something else that is better for your life and current situation.  Then revisit the situation again in a couple of years to see if the time is right. Here's to great success! </p><br><br><br>
